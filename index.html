<h1>Hi there!</h1>
<p>Hellloooo! This basic website will teach you the basics of Xbox 360 Modding. This website covers most "big"? or popular mods such as DVD Flashing, RGH, JTAG and xKeys.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h1>RGH/JTAG</h1>
<p>Right so, The most popular Xbox 360 mod in my opinion is the RGH mod which stands for "Reset Glitch Hack". This is because this method "resets" the console in very specific timing in order to "glitch" the console which then bypasses the security.</p>
